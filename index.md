# Welcome to the Chinese Android BMW head units Wiki

This page is dedicated to tuning, reverse engineering, and hacking of Chinese BMW Android Head units. These units come from different vendors like [Avin](https://avinusa.com/), [Eway](http://www.ewaygps.com/), [Ugode](http://www.ugode.com/) and [Mekede](https://mekede.nl.aliexpress.com/store/909923). A lot of people actually buy them on Ali Express directly from China.
Most units replace the original screen from BMW with a screen that incorporates the Android system and all other logic to interact with the cars original systems through the [CANBUS interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus).
